▶️ How to Run

Basically, there are 2 different pages to run (Home and Login). We are working to make it better, but for now you can run it using the steps below:

🔹 Method 1: Direct Open
Open HOME/index.html → Home Page
Open login/login.html → Login Page


🔹 Method 2: Local Server (Recommended)
Open terminal in the project folder.
Run command make sure you are in home or login floder :  
python -m http.server


Open browser and go to:
 → Home Page   :  http://localhost:8000/HOME/index.html    
,→ Login Page   :  http://localhost:8000/login/login.html
 

✅ That’s it! Your website is live.
